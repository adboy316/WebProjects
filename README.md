# Project 1
This is a very basic cataloging website that allows users to search for books in a database and post reviews. It was designed with Python, Flask, Postgres, SQLAlchemy, HTML, and CSS. 

The tables.sql file contains all the tables that were created for the project. 

The imports.py script has a short script for importaing books from a books.csv file, which contains a list of books. 

The templates folder contains all the html used in this project, and the static folder has all the css.
